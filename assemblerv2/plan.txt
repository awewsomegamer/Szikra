The assembler will start reading until it reaches a new line
in which case it will stop reading and send the generated series
of tokens to the processor. The processor will then put them
together and evaluate them regularly and write them to the 
out file. If an error is encountered during the evaluation
process, the evaluator will return, and print an error message,
and the assembler will continue working on the rest of the file
reporting errors. When an error is encountered, the error flag
will be set, and the assembler will stop outputting to the
output file.


struct label {
	uint32_t address; // The address of the label, 0 based
	char* name; /// Label name
	uint32_t* references; // A list of addresses which correspond to un fill addresses in the output file that this label owns
	uint32_t line; // Line number label was found on
};
