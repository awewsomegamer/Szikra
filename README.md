# Szikra Architecture

### What
A revised version of awewsomegamer/Compiler and awewsomegamer/Emulator

### Why
The old assembler wasn't modular, by this I mean that it relied on the use
of sections, and that each operation would have only two arguments.
With this new system I hope to be able to add more instruction arguments as
well as directives local labels, and many more things to make the assembler
better.
